This project is a HTML webpage made from scratch.
It consists of a homepage, a couple of recipes and some extra pages.
All built from cmd line in VS Code, wrote with the help of Odin curriculum.
I hope to succesfully manage the project with Git commands, write pure HTML chunks and in the future add some CSS styling into the project.
